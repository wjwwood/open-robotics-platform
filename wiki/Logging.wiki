= Logging Documentation =

#This page documents the logs in ORP as well as sequences in which they occur.

This is important to document because the dashboard relies on the format of the messages to properly monitor the server.

== Format ==

Log consist of several elements:
  * Logger - This is the origin of the log message (ORPD, Sandbox, Control Code, HWM, etc...)
  * Log Level - This is the level of the log message (data, debug, info, warning, error, critical)
  * Log Message - This is the most important part to standardize and document (ex: `Server Ready`)
